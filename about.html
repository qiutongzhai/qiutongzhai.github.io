        <!-- <h2>Bio</h2> -->
        <p>Zhai Qiutong (b.1999, China) is a visual artist currently based in Singapore. Zhai's works explore the fragility of human presence and the multilayered individual identity. She asks the questions of how we are living in our current place and time and what kind of imprint do we leave behind. Her works often pay attention to sensual details and sensorial textures of materials-as-objects, rather than their conceptual embbodiments and information-carrying capacities. Through unconventional choice of material, its textual detail and capacity as memory object is accentuated. Ultimately these objects prompt us to imagine the world in a new scale of time and space.</p>
        <p>Her works often require close looking, as an extensive range of material are used in her installation works, such as clay, resin and soil among many others, to create fascinating textural details. Zhai also uses VR sculpting as a tool to prototype her large scale projects. Her recent works include her installation <i>Soil Series (2021)</i>, <i>Untitled 2020 (2020)</i>, <i>resin series (2018)</i>. Zhai is currently pursuing Arts and Humanities at Yale-NUS College and graduated from ACJC A level art programme in 2018. Her <i>Soil Series</i> have been shown at the EOS exhibition at Yale-NUS College in 2021, as well as the Untitled Exhibition in 2020.</p>
